**Tensify:**

Tensify is a real-time tension map plugin for Autodesk Maya.  
It calculates **stretch** and **compression** on your mesh as it deforms, and writes the results to vertex colors - useful for various simulation and shading purposes.

**Installation:**
1. If you're using **Maya 2025.3** copy **Tensify.mll** to "*your Maya installation path\bin\plug-ins*"
2. For other versions of Maya, you'll need to **compile** the plugin from the **source files** using a supported C++ compiler to generate a **.mll** file for your specific version. Once compiled, copy the file to "*your Maya installation path\bin\plug-ins*" 
3. Copy the **AEtensifyTemplate.mel** to "*your Maya installation path>\scripts\AETemplates*"
4. Load the plugin via **Maya Plugin Manager**

**How to Use:**
1. Select your mesh in Mayaâ€™s viewport
2. Run the **Tensify.py** script in the Maya Script Editor - a tensify node will be created and automatically connected to your mesh.
